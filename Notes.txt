What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to
learn from vast volumes of data and solve specific problems. It uses computer 
algorithms that improve their efficiency automatically through experience.



Machine learning is a subset of AI, which enables the machine to automatically learn
from data, improve performance from past experiences, and make predictions.
Machine learning contains a set of algorithms that work on a huge amount of data. 
Data is fed to these algorithms to train them, and on the basis of training, they 
build the model & perform a specific task.

These ML algorithms help to solve different business problems like Regression,
Classification, Forecasting, Clustering, and Associations, etc.

ML types-
There are primarily three types of machine learning: 
Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.



Supervised-
Supervised machine learning is based on supervision.

that uses labeled data to train machine learning models. In labeled data, 
the output is already known. 
The model just needs to map the inputs to the respective outputs. 


Working of supervised--
Supervised learning algorithms take labeled inputs and map them to the known outputs, 
which means you already know the target variable. 


Supervised learning algorithms are generally used for solving classification
 and regression problems.


Classification: Supervised learning problem that involves predicting a class label.
Regression: Supervised learning problem that involves predicting a numerical label.







Unsupervised Learning
Overview:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses unlabeled data to train
 machines. Unlabeled data doesnâ€™t have a fixed output variable. The model learns from 
the data, discovers the patterns and features in the data, and returns the output.
